I have always wanted to know how many parkruns reside within my local county, Nottinghamshire.

There are various apps out there that have parkrun challenges, but none of them ever break it down to UK County level. (The most common is UK 'regions' for example East Midlands, but this is very large).

So I have done it myself, and plan to do it for all counties so I can track it.

### Nottinghamshire Parkruns

I am ONE AWAY from completing Nottinghamshire! Clumber Park is the last remaining, which makes sense because it is at least 1 hour to drive there.
