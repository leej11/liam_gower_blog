Continuing my fun mapping my UK parkrun data, here is all the UK Counties mapped, with some stats on my completion rates.

### Parkrun UK County Completion

The first plot maps out every county in the UK, and colours it according to my completion percentage (percentage of events in that county I've run).

</div>

### Parkrun UK County Completion with Events

The second plot is an extension of the first, by adding in markers for every UK parkrun event.

It does make it very busy, but once you zoom in to county level it's great because you can see what parkrun events you might want to go to on your next parkrun tourism.

</div>
