So if you've read my post about [learning web development]({{< ref "learning_web_development" >}} "learning web development"), you will be aware that my current hobby is learning full stack web development.

I've completed a number of tutorial videos, and now I'm trying to put together a mini Strava/Running dashboard.

Here's a quick screen recording of what I've achieved after 1.5 months of learning the "PERN" stack.

I know it's not great, but I'm super happy having managed to hook frontend and backend together and render a cool chart!
