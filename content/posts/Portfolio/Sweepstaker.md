### The Project

At the start of June 2024, the UEFA Euros 2024 began. And one of my favourite things to do is
enter a [sweepstake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweepstake).

For the last few tournaments, amongst family and friends I have organised a small-scale sweepstake
for fun. I've never won...

When this tournament came around, I realised it is a _perfect_ opportunity for
a beginner ReactJS / frontend project. And so, my first frontend portfolio project was born - the Sweepstaker.

Here is the video I made of this year's draw, showcasing my handywork in ReactJS:

### The Outcome

If I ever get round to it, I would love to make this more generalised so that anyone online
can make use of it (e.g. currently names are hardcoded haha):

- User input forms
  - If it was hosted, I'd want people to be able to submit their own entrant names to be drawn!
- A menu
  - My plan is to learn some basic animation and show it off with the sliding/expanding sidebar menu.

Anyway, I'm super proud of where I got to already. I built this from scratch in like a week
a couple hours here and there in the lead up to the tournament beginning!
