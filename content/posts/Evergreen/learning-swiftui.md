In June 2025 I started learning Swift UI. I've been following HackingWithSwift and his [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

### 8th August 2025

Today I just finished Day 42 which constituted Project #8. It was an app that
presents a grid view of the Apollo Space Missions and then you are able to click
through and see the details of the missions _and_ the astronauts.

I am super proud of it. I know it's literally me just following along a tutorial's
code, but I am just proud that I understand it all.

<div class="image-grid">
    <img src="/images/moonshot1.png" alt="app image 1">
    <img src="/images/moonshot2.png" alt="app image 2">
    <img src="/images/moonshot3.png" alt="app image 3">
    <img src="/images/moonshot4.png" alt="app image 4">
</div>

This course is so good. I'm really looking forward to learning how to link up with a backend / store data. After that I will be keen to build an app on my own (I have 2 ideas in mind for fun).

I'll update this page when I have learnt more :D See ya!
